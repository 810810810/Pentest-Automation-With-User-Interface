# Pentest-Automation-With-User-Interface
simple Bash script to automate some of the penetration testing process. It prompts the user to enter a target IP address or hostname,
and then runs an nmap scan to identify open ports. Based on the open ports identified, it provides the user with the option to run either a basic
or comprehensive scan. If the user chooses a comprehensive scan, the script runs vulnerability scans using Nessus, scans for subdomains using Sublist3r, 
and searches for exploits using Searchsploit. After these scans, the script prompts the user to choose an open port to scan using Dirb, a web content scanner. 
If the script finds directories on that port, it prompts the user to choose a directory to scan using Sqlmap, an automatic SQL injection tool.
The user can choose the intensity of the scan. The script also provides an option to scan another directory on the same port
